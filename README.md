# MERN-Blog

MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) blog application allows both registered and unregistered users to interact with blog posts and comments. Unregistered users can view posts, comments, user profiles, and sign up. Registered users can also log in/out, create, edit, and delete their posts, update their profiles and passwords, add comments, and manage their comments. The database utilizes Mongoose, with User, Post, and Comment schemas. The project structure includes models, routes, controllers, and a React.js frontend. To get started, clone the repo, install dependencies, set up MongoDB, configure user authentication, and start the application. Customization is possible to suit specific needs, such as adding search functionality or user roles.
